Usability

- Finished all tasks except for 2.7.1 Static Feed Offline Accessibility.

- Navigation through my site is very usable and straightforward.
- You can toggle between the login and register page.
- After successful login or register, you are taken to the homepage which is the user's feed.
- The header contains the navbar where Quickpic is clickable and takes you back to the feed or the login page (if you're not logged in).
- The navbar also contains a search bar, a navigation link to the current users profile and a logout link. 
- On the feed page, it tells the user if their feed is empty and then shows around 15 random posts so that the user can find people to follow.
- Each post on the feed shows all necessary information and options to like or comment are shown in a nice way.
- You can toggle to show or hide the comments and likes by pressing on the coloured text.
- Whenever a username is shown, it is also clickable and renders there profile page.
- Each profile page (except for your own) has a button to follow/unfollow.
- The profile pages are layed out with the user information and followers/following information at the top, followed by the users post. 
- The user can also view/make likes and comments on the posts visible on the profile page.
- The search bar mentioned earlier can be used to search through the users feed, or you can search for a user by their username. You can select what type of search (either feed or users) and the default is set on searching through their feed. 
- A result page also renders upon submission of a non-empty input, showing the amount of results and related posts or a user.
- All clickable components have a hover styling where the opacity decreases which makes it obvious what is clickable.
- You are able to refresh to the same page.
- You are able to go back to the previous page.
- You are able to logout and login or register as a different or the same user.
- Used a minimalistic colour scheme and utilised colours to distinguish clickable content and buttons.
